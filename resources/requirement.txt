To clarify:

Method 1:

website where we need to display the XML is here: http://79.170.40.241/liquidenginetest.com/index.php - FTP 79.170.44.11 user: liquidenginetest.com pwd:UNs.x^6K7
The XML we need is here: FTP: 79.170.44.11 pwd:UNs.x^6K7 user: liquidengine.com path to file: public_html/index.php

Method 2: (if it's even possible):
Have the the XML file copied to http://79.170.40.241/liquidenginetest.com/xml/ on a weekly basis
The website will then have the file local and won't need to access from the FTP server.
If this is too long winded, then don't bother.... just stick with method 1.
